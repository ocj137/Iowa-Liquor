# Iowa-Liquor

Iowa Liquor Sales
I will be using the pandas data transformation functionality (melt, pivot, groupby, apply).

Context of the data
The state of Iowa provides many data sets on their website, including this dataset which contains transactions for all stores that have a class E liquor license.
The data can also be found directly on their website, which allows us to explore it graphically and download it (though it doesn't work very well).

NOTE: Some may have computer issues with the full dataset. In this case, feel free to use this 10% dataset version of Iowa liquor sales. You may want to use it anyway to test and prototype your code since it will be faster, before running it on the full dataset.
