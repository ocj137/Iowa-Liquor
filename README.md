## Iowa-Liquor

This is the Iowa Liquor Sales project

Here  I  use the pandas data transformation functions (melt, pivot, groupby, apply).
For this project of liquor use in Iowa, I will use the pandas data transformation functions (melt, pivot, groupby, apply).

Context of the data
The state of Iowa provides many data sets on their website, including this dataset which contains transactions for all stores that have a class E liquor license.
The data can also be found directly on their website, which allows us to explore it graphically and download it (though it doesn't work very well).

NOTE: There may be` computer issues with the full dataset. In this case, use this 10% dataset version of Iowa liquor sales. May want to use 10% anyway to test and prototype the code since it will be faster, before running it on the full dataset.
